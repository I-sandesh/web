      Bachelor of Technology (BTech) is a professional undergraduate engineering degree programme awarded to candidates after they complete four years of study in the field. Engineering is one of the most popular courses in India and there are many institutes that offer the course to aspiring students.

For admissions, the most common BTech entrance examinations are JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Along with these national level entrance examinations, there are many state and private level entrance examinations that the students can attempt for admissions. The basic eligibility criteria for BTech is class 12 with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. However, there are additional criteria in every entrance exam and institute. Some of the institutes also conduct admission to their courses on a merit basis i.e. based on marks of candidates in their class 12 board exams.

What Are the Different Types of Engineering?
Engineering entails the design and creation of devices, machines, and structures.
The field is typically divided into five main branches, with hundreds of subfields.
Students who major in engineering can generally expect to earn a high salary.
Many consider engineering a challenging major due to its emphasis on math and science.
Engineering is one of the most popular and lucrative majors college students can pursue. An in-demand STEM field, engineering offers an array of professional opportunities in many industries, such as oil, renewable energy, and medicine.

In fact, there are so many types of engineering that students often aren't sure which kind they want to study. One of the first steps to figuring out whether an engineering degree is right for you — and, if so, which field you should choose — is to learn about the key differences among the major engineering branches.

What Are the 5 Main Types of Engineering?
To engineer something means to create, build, or design it. As such, engineering entails any scientific or technological branch that deals with designing and developing machines, engines, and other products or structures.

Some types of engineering are subfields of other kinds of engineering. For example, environmental engineering is often described as a subset of civil engineering. Some branches, like industrial engineering, are considered interdisciplinary because they combine aspects from multiple disciplines.

Other types of engineering may not fit neatly into any one category. These include nuclear engineering, biological engineering, and rehabilitation engineering.

Most sources divide engineering into the following five branches.
<br /><br />
1. Civil Engineering
Often thought to be the oldest engineering discipline, civil engineering focuses on constructing, designing, and maintaining physical structures used by the public, such as dams, bridges, tunnels, roads, airports, subway systems, and water supply systems. Many of today's engineers specialize in building eco-friendly architecture to combat climate change.

Civil engineers work in many industries, like transportation, urban planning, and space. Famous civil engineering projects include the Great Wall of China, the Panama Canal, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Eiffel Tower.

2. Chemical engineering
In the broadest sense of the term, chemical engineering deals with chemicals. These engineers design and manufacture materials and products using scientific principles from chemistry, biology, math, and physics. They may also come up with innovative processes to use and transform energy.

Chemical engineers can work with microorganisms, food, pharmaceuticals, and fuels. Often performing experiments and other tasks in labs, many also use computers to design experiments.

3. Mechanical Engineering
Mechanical engineering entails the development and production of mechanical systems and other devices in motion. These professionals use problem-solving, critical thinking, and the principles of math and physics to transform concepts into functional products, such as ships, firearms, household appliances, turbines, and vehicles.

Today's mechanical engineers rely on many of the same core components that have been used for thousands of years, including wheels, springs, screws, and axles.
